If you want to get good at programming, you should go and complete all the exercises in Automate the Boring Stuff (<https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>) in Python 3. Once you have done that you will be capable of just about any scripting task in Python if you have the time to do your research and work through it.

For now, I just want you to work through Chapters 9-12 of the Automate the Boring Stuff curriculum. We skip the first few chapters, but you generally have learned them from CodeAcademy already. If you're having trouble with Chapter 9 (you probably will), step back a few chapters and work through them until you feel comfortable moving forward. 

For this assignment, I want you to work through Chapter 9 and write code that will automagically create and modify files on the hard drive for you.

When you are done, submit a link to a Github repo that contains the project you completed. I don't expect this to be easy, so ask questions in #python, look at earlier sections of the book, and make use of Google. This is fairly difficult but you should be ready!
