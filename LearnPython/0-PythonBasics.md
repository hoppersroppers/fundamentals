It's time for you to learn your first programming language!

Let me get this out of the way: I don't think Python is the best language to learn how to program with. Python is a programming language that has found incredible success, largely due to the fact that code written in it is readable and things just work. Programming is an exacting art, and Python doesn't force you to work very hard to understand why things are the way they are. Other languages, specifically C are better for learning the nitty-gritty, which so far has been what this course focused on.

So why are we starting with Python? Simply, Python gets things done. It just works. And for the beginning programmer, I don't want you to have to worry about all the crap that other languages make you care about. What I care about is you have the ability to do things, whether that is automate your life or to crush CTF challenges.

While Python isn't the most popular programming language yet, it will be in the next few years. It runs the backends of many giant companies, but also is the dominant language for data science, and is the language of choice for many people who need to move fast and get things done. 

Again, no language is perfect. There are tradeoffs with all languages, some do better than others at various activities, some are worse. Python is the most straightforward language to write code and do things with, and has the best documentation examples for you to work off of.  It is considered to be "slow", but when people tell you that, ignore them and continue writing your code. You will be done writing your program by the time they start trying to troubleshoot why their program doesn't work. Don't argue with people about programming languages, anyone who does that for fun is the worst. Just let them have it.

If you want to learn C, and you should to get a deeper understanding of computing, [check out my rough roadmap](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/roadmap/training/c.html) once you have finished this course. 

# What is Python?

Python is a language developed primarily by Guido van Rossum, the affectionately named 'Benevolent Dictator for Life'. He began work on it in 1989 and since then thousands of people have contributed to the core code base, and even more have written modules and extensions to allow more to be done with the language. Potentially the most important design consideration for the language was that it was developed to be highly extensible, making it as easy as possible for people to build extensions to allow programmers to use others' code in order to do more with less lines of code. 

Other aspects of the Python philosophy are: 

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Readability counts

Overall, Python is often described using the words: High level, interpreted, dynamically typed, garbage collected, readable. For the assignment you'll define those. Don't worry about what dynamically typed means right now. 

As a fun note, the language is named for Monty Python's Flying Circus, a legendary British comedy show from the 70s. I really recommend you watch some of their sketches, or the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It's on Netflix, but many of the sketches are on Youtube. 

Assignment:

1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages? Which is Python?
2. What is the importance of readability in a language?
3. What is a garbage collected language? Why does that make it easier for programmers.
