# Show What You Know

I talk a big game about all of this being about what you know and what
you can do, but there is something I have to tell you.

If you do not prepare the way you present yourself, put yourself out
there, and be willing to fail, or be ignored, or be turned down, you're
never going to be able to put the skills and knowledge to work.

You have to be willing to enter the arena, especially if you are not
feeling "ready" for it. You have learned (really taught yourself) VMs,
Linux, how to build a website, and wrote some complicated Python
programs. Every single thing in security and computing derives from
these things. The next steps are harder to figure out, but hopefully the
Roppers Roadmaps can assist.

Now, for the important stuff:

At the beginning of the class I told you that I will help you with your
resume once you get this far, and I meant it. Go and update your resume
with everything you have done in this course and make sure to add links
to your git repos. Once you have it done and formatted, email it to me
at d.m.devey@gmail.com with the Subj: Roppers Resume Review . When I
can, I'll look it over and give you some feedback. I also strongly
encourage you to turn a few assignments into blogposts, and do writeups
on some of the programs you wrote and things you learned. Fill out that
personal website to show that you are a professional and have the
ability to do technical writing. As much as I wish it was all hacking,
most jobs care about your reading and writing ability just as much.

If you want to, I can put you on the Roppers job board. It will be a
place on our site that anyone can click to find some information about
you and your resume. I won't be a middle man for that, but if you want
to get yourself visibility, I'd love to help. I can also tweet and see
if anyone in the network is looking to hire.

I'm here to educate, but I'm really here to try and help you out. Now
that you have gotten this far, let me know how.
