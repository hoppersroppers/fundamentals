## Dedication
This training is dedicated to the memories of [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), [Bassel Khartabil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Khartabil) and those named on the [National Cryptologic Memorial](https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/cryptologic-memorial/cryptologic-memorial-list.shtml).



After a decade of teaching myself how to use computers and a few years training others, I went and made the site that I wish had existed when I got into the field back in middle school. 

Security is the shield of the modern world, and we need good people on the wall. Thanks for being up there.

Hack the planet
