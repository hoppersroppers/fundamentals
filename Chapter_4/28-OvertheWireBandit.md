# Over the Wire Bandit
Here it is: Over the Wire...

You might have heard of this before. It's the big one.

This is a classic set of challenges that every member of our team has fought through, and while it takes some time, you should have had enough experience to figure out what you need to do. It won't be easy, and it might not be the most fun, but completion of this challenge is the single greatest determining factor in whether or not you continue along this journey. This is where you have to grind it out, make things happen, get stuck, learn things, and really spend some quality time with man pages.

Let us know if you get stuck on any challenge for longer than a half hour, we will gladly point you in the right direction. And no cheating, as Hemingway once said, ?There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.? We like Hemingway. He  was a big fan of boats and adventures. We are too.

While there are 25 Bandit levels, at this time we only expect you to be able to complete 1-13. They will be hard, but we know you can do them. The rest of the levels are saved for different places throughout the rest of the course. 

Whenever you finish lessons, 1, 5, 10 let me know in chat! When you finish 13, let everyone know in Slack! 

If you ever get stuck on anything for more than a half hour, message us in #tech_support and we will help you out! Don't worry, I have no problems giving you very specific instructions to get to the next stage. If your googling keeps popping up Bandit walkthroughs instead of references, use the search operator -"bandit" to clean up the search results.

Good luck!!!! We are not going to let you end your journey here!!!
