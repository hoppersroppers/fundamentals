You should have validated this prior to registering for the course. There is a huge range of experience someone can have with Linux and VMs, so I don't make any attempt at pre-scribing what skills you should have.

If you are not sure if you should validate this, in my opinion the best way to see if you are ready is to play the Bandit CTF challenges up to level 14. <http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/>

If you can roll through those without too much trouble, you should be fine. If not, I recommend you check out the <https://linuxjourney.com/> resources and go through all of the Grasshopper and Journeyman material prior to trying to work your way through Bandit again.
