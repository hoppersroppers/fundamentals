# What You Will Learn

[Check out our free course!](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/mod/page/view.php?id=554)

There are a wide variety of skills required to succeed in a CTF competition.

This course will attempt to teach you everything you need to know to start and take on any competition. 

First, we will start with how to use linux and linux command line tools. Then after a brief introduction to python scripting, we will launch into CTF specific topics.

Forensics is comprised of host-based and network forensics and we will go into the basics of that. Cryptography will be brief and will go over basic problems and how to solve them. We will also go into the basics of web exploitation and how some of those challenges work.

This is a beginner course, so we will not be getting into Reverse Engineering or Binary Exploitation at all. This is meant to prepare you for the picoCTF competition where you will have to figure out how to use the skills and resources you learned in this course to solve problems as you go.
