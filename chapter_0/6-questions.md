# Questions

[Check out our free course!](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/mod/page/view.php?id=1000)

We expect you to be constantly coming across words, phrases, and entire concepts that you have never seen before and are totally lost in. When you have to get things done, you'll have to learn more about it and one of the best ways to get those holes in your knowledge filled is to ask questions. 

Here are some guidelines for asking questions.

* There is no such thing as a bad question, especially on this site
* Write up your problem with as much information as possible
* Describe your problem's symptoms in chronological order
* Describe the goal, not the step you are on
* Follow up with a brief note on the solution

You can private message us, post on the forum, throw it on Slack, whatever. No one here will ever get annoyed, because there is really no such thing as a bad question, just one you haven't researched enough.?Even if your question isn't related to our courses, we are happy to help.

If you're in person, just ask. It's faster than Googling and you'll get more out of it.?

We already told you what RTFM stood for, so now we're gonna have you do it.?

Visit this [man-page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash) and write down the first three things you don?t understand.?(I don't expect you to make it past the Name, "bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell", there is so much to unpack in just that).

 Then Google one of them and figure out what it is. Submit a sentence or two explaining the thing you didn?t know.??For the love of everything, don?t read any further once you are done with that. Remember Rule 3 of the Hacker Attitude, ?Boredom and Drudgery are evil.? If you're not getting anything out of something at any point in this course, don't do it, and leave us feedback that we are wasting your time. We mean that. You won't hurt our feelings.
