Alright, I'm gonna be honest. Doing all these Linux Journey assignments can be super boring, and is a ton of hard work. If you want to split it up and do some theory, I really recommend you check out our Intro. to Security course.

It's a nice change from marching through Linux commands like this and will give you a good base to apply the knowledge you learn in this course to the real world. 

If you think you have good momentum right now, just keep pushing!
