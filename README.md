Roppers Academy is a website dedicated to providing the best training possible for students who are new to the field. One of the ways that we do this is through a series of free courses.

This the text version of the Roppers Academy Introduction to Computing Fundamentals course. It is a self-paced curriculum that was made to help our students over the first big learning hurdles and finally have a path forward. Our material is intended to be accessible for a student with no prior knowledge, but is worthwhile for any seasoned expert to take so that they can learn more about the subjects they have never had to dive into. Graduates of this course should be confident that they are fully prepared to continue their education wherever it leads.

This site is generated from a course hosted at:

All the material is available here, but in order to get the full benefits of our course we recommend registering so that we can track your progress, grade your submissions, and provide feedback and support when you need it.

If you have any questions, hit us on Twitter @roppersacademy.

If you have recommended changes or feedback, this is all available on GitHub for anyone to submit issues or pull requests. Thanks for the help!
