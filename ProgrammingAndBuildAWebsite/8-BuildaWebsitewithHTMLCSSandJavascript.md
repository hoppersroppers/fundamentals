# Build a Website with HTML CSS and Javascript
Now, learn how to make a website with the Github First Week tutorials.

Feel free to make it as complicated or basic as you would like, and have fun playing around with it. 
   
As an addition to the tutorial, add a snippet of Javascript that adds an OnClick event.

My favorite student made site so far [was this one](https://mrashleyball.github.io/Roppers-Computing-Fundamentals-Build-a-Website-with-HTML-CSS-and-Javascript/) by Mr. Ashley Ball. I think it does a better job teaching than the tutorials! 

1. Submit a link to your github.io site.
2. Explain what the OnClick event does and how it works.
