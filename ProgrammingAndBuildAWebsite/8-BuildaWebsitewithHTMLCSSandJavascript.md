Now, learn how to make a website with the Github First Week tutorials.

<https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-week-on-github>

Feel free to make it as complicated or basic as you would like, and have fun playing around with it. 
   
As an addition to the tutorial, add a snippet of Javascript that adds an OnClick event.

My favorite student made site so far [was this one](https://mrashleyball.github.io/Roppers-Computing-Fundamentals-Build-a-Website-with-HTML-CSS-and-Javascript/) by Mr. Ashley Ball. I think it does a better job teaching than the tutorials! 

1. Submit a link to your github.io site.
2. Explain what the OnClick event does and how it works.
