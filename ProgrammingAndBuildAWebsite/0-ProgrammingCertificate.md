Welcome to the Programming section of the Ropper's Fundamentals course.

When you learn how to program, you learn how to use one of the greatest tools that humanity has ever had. It is the lever that has built the computer you are on now, the internet, and most of the modern world. Once you learn how to program, you are no longer one person, and can do just about anything. 

We will start with Python in this course, but the fundamentals remain the same across languages. What matters is that you work hard, take things in, and start DOING!

By the end of this chapter you will have completed a few projects and you will earn this certificate! <https://badgr.com/public/badges/XB9JuQmCQaKfJVUvuYNcQg>

Thanks for sticking around so far, let's go crush some Python!
